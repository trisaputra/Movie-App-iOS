Since past Apple's keynote, where **SwiftUI** was announced, tons of docs, examples, videos and tutorials have appeared. The goal of this repository is to gather all this information having a unique place where looking for info about **SwiftUI**.

**SwiftUI** is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs. With a declarative Swift syntax that’s easy to read and natural to write, SwiftUI works seamlessly with new Xcode design tools to keep your code and design perfectly in sync. Automatic support for Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, localization, and accessibility means your first line of **SwiftUI** code is already the most powerful UI code you’ve ever written.
